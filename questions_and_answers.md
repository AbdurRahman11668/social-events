###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A
explanation: const food is declared as an array containing four emoji strings. const info is declared as an object with a favoriteFood property, initially set to the first element of the food array, which is "🍕". info.favoriteFood is reassigned to "🍝", so now the info object looks like this: { favoriteFood: "🍝" }. After i put the food in console.log(food), which logs the food array to the console. Since i haven't modified the food array directly, it remains unchanged.

<p>

#### Answer: B
explanation: I have defined a parameter name, which is expected to be provided when I call the function. However, in my console.log(sayHi()) statement, I am calling the function without passing any argument, which will give a result in an undefined because I didn't provide the required name parameter.

let count = 0;

```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
explanation: count is initialized to 0. The forEach method call the each element in the nums array. For each element (num), the code inside the arrow function is executed. Inside the arrow function, there's an if statement that checks if num is truthy, then count is incremented by 1.
